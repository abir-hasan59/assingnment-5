              The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web
              documents, representing the structure of a webpage in a tree-like
              form where every element (such as tags, attributes, text) is an
              object. It allows developers to interact with and manipulate the
              HTML content of a web page dynamically.

              By ID: Use getElementById() to select a single element by its
              unique id attribute. By Class: Use getElementsByClassName() to
              select all elements that share the same class name. By Tag Name:
              Use getElementsByTagName() to select all elements with a specific
              HTML tag name (e.g., div, p). By CSS Selector: Use querySelector()
              to select the first element that matches a CSS selector, or
              querySelectorAll() to select all elements that match the selector.
              By Name Attribute: Use getElementsByName() to select elements
              based on their name attribute, often used in forms.

              Event delegation is a technique in the DOM where a single event
              listener is attached to a parent element to manage events
              triggered by its child elements. Instead of adding individual
              listeners to each child, the parent handles events as they bubble
              up from the children. <br>
              This is useful because:
              <br>
              Improved performance: Reduces the number of event listeners, which saves
              memory and enhances performance, especially in large, dynamic
              interfaces. <br>Dynamic element handling: It allows you to handle
              events on newly created child elements without needing to attach
              new listeners.<br> Simplified code: Centralizes event management in
              one place, making it easier to maintain.

                Event delegation is a technique in the DOM where a single event listener is attached to a parent element to manage events triggered by its child elements. Instead of attaching separate listeners to each child, the parent element catches the event as it "bubbles up" from the child (thanks to event bubbling in the DOM). When an event occurs, the parent identifies the actual target (the child that triggered the event) and responds accordingly. This approach is particularly useful because it simplifies event handling, especially when dealing with dynamic or large sets of elements. It improves performance by reducing the number of event listeners attached to individual elements, which conserves memory and processing power. Additionally, it allows handling of future elements that might be added dynamically to the parent, without the need for additional event listeners, making the code more flexible and maintainable.</p>
